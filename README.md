# Arduino-Synth
Basic Ardunio synth created as a final project for a class, based on https://www.hackster.io/arduinoenigma/a-simple-five-button-polyphonic-arduino-uno-based-piano-b367be

Can play several different songs, though they each use only 5 notes so not too complex. Original code was modified to change the song selection, and instead of it being a game the user simply can press any button and that corresponding LED will light up.
